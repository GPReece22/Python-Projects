# Python Examples

This is some python code written at the start  of my degree, there is a mixture of in class work projects from a 
textbook and an assignment. It is far from perfect but I like to keep it here to show where I started and remind myself 
how far I have come, who knows I may even come back and improve it, if I ever get round to it.

Feel free to take the source code, make any adjustments or just play around with it.
